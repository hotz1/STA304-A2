# STA304-A2

Files for a class assignment for STA304 at the University of Toronto.

For this assignment, I took data from the [Toronto Open Data Portal](https://open.toronto.ca/) which detailed delays to TTC buses during the first 6 months of 2021, and analyzed the data to determine which factors would affect waiting times for delayed buses, as well as determining if it is possible to predict expected waiting times for a delayed TTC bus.

The data which was collected from the City of Toronto's data portal was analyzed using R, and these analyses are shown in the RMarkdown document in this repo. The PDF file in this repo was created by knitting the RMarkdown document, and is formatted as a report, but the analyses and R code itself is only available in the RMarkdown document.

The two Microsoft Excel files in this repo were collected straight from the Toronto Open Data Portal, and were imported into R to analyse further, as described in the RMarkdown document in this repo. These files represent a 'moment in time', as the data on the Toronto Open Data Portal is updated regularly, so these CSV files may no longer be accessible on the Open Data Portal.
